        <div class="cover">Welcome To<br>Part-2</div>
        <div id="line"></div>
        <div class="chapter">Let's Start<br><h4>Brisbane,Australia a city crowded with buildings, new and old. Nestled amongst the towering buildings of this city was a small dojo. A young man trained there quietly, his face covered by the hood of his jacket. The young man was Jin Kazama.

            Day after day, Jin trained in the traditional art of karate. Ever since Heihachi's betrayal, Jin loathed everything about himself; his Mishima bloodline, his fighting style, the Devil Gene in his blood, everything. He gave up the Mishima-Ryu fighting style, thanks to the dojo master's training, and mastered traditional karate.
            
            Jin's thoughts burned with the desire to destroy the evil Mishima bloodline, the bloodline of his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima, and his father, Kazuya.
            
            One day, Jin heard rumors that The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 was announced.
            
            A once in a lifetime opportunity to exterminate the Mishima clan... without hesitation, Jin hardened his resolve to enter the tournament.
            
            After fighting many opponents in the tournament, including Hwoarang near the end where they promised to fight in the next tournament, Jin finally had a match with Kazuya, his father. On his way to fight Kazuya, Jin encountered the Tekken Force soldiers. Jin managed to take down a number of them but was outnumbered and eventually defeated. He was then taken prisoner by the soldiers.Heihachi's Tekken Force soldiers held Jin captive at Hon-Maru. After Kazuya had been led to Hon-Maru by Heihachi, Kazuya manages to knock Heihachi out of the door with a telekinetic force due to being possessed by Devil. When Devil attempts to get the other half of the Devil Gene within Jin, Jin gains tattoos on both his chest and arms, but to Devil's dismay, Jin also inherited the Kazama blood, which restrained the assimilation. Kazuya manages to regain control of himself and he merges Devil and himself into one personality. Kazuya tries to wake his son. When Jin wakes up, he manages to break the chains and begins to suffer from his Devil Gene which engulfed him in a purple haze. Jin angrily expressed his wish for his father to be dead. Jin fought Kazuya and defeated him, only to be confronted by Heihachi, whom Jin also dispatched; but when the time came to fulfil his dream of killing the Mishima bloodline, he faltered after seeing a hallucination of his mother, Jun Kazama. As a result, Jin dropped his grandfather and said, "Thank my mother, Jun Kazama," before flying off into the night. At the end of the scene, a single white feather is shown falling along with several black feathers, implying that the white feather belongs to Angel, which signifies Jin's good side.</h4></div>
