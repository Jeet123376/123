            Tekken-3<br>
            Version-1<br>
            <h4>Jin is Kazuya Mishima and Jun Kazama's son. He received intense training under his grandfather Heihachi Mishima - all in an effort to avenge the loss of his mother by fighting and defeating Ogre. This Tournament is his chance to test his strength and face his destiny.<br><u><b>Version-2</b></u><br>
                At the age of fifteen, Jin discovered that he was Kazuya Mishima's son, and also that his mother, Jun Kazama, had died (the actual truth was that she had gone missing). Jin, after having survived the attack of Ogre, went and found Heihachi Mishima, and trained himself under the supervision of Heihachi every day with the intention of defeating Ogre, who supposedly killed his mother. Heihachi was not only his grandfather, but also proved to be a reliable teacher.

                Four years later, having mastered the Kazama and Mishima fighting styles, Jin began his path as a martial artist.
                
                During the game, Jin fought and defeated numerous opponents in the tournament. He also fought against his rival, Hwoarang, although it ended in a draw. Despite this, Jin continued on through the tournament and finally arrived at the temple where Ogre was located. Just as he approached the entrance to the temple, Heihachi appeared and forced him to fight in order to lure out Ogre, but kept this from Jin. Instead, he told Jin that he wanted to test his abilities and determine whether or not he was strong enough to fight Ogre, but Heihachi had ulterior motives.
                
                Eventually, Jin defeated his grandfather, and Ogre then appeared before him. Angered by the sight of his mother's "killer", Jin engaged Ogre in a fight, fueled by rage. During the fight, Ogre absorbed Heihachi's power, allowing him to become True Ogre. The fight continued.<br><u><b>Ending Discription</b></u><br>"Dirty Blood": Jin defeated True Ogre and had avenged his mother at last. Suddenly due to the extreme battle, True Ogre violently exploded. Mere seconds after his victory, Jin is attacked by Heihachi's Tekken Force soldiers; he received multiple gunshot wounds. Slowly succumbing to death, Heihachi shot Jin in the head with a handgun, therefore killing his own grandson. However, when Heihachi turned his back and walked away, he saw the bodies of his soldiers before him and turned around to see Jin morphed into his devil form, Devil Jin. Jin then slammed Heihachi through a wall of the temple and violently hurled Heihachi down into the ground. Finally, Jin spread his wings and flew off. Heihachi, weakly, sat up and watched as his grandson, Devil Jin, disappeared into the night.</h4>
